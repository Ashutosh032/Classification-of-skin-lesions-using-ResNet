# Skin Lesions Classification

## Overview
This project is designed for skin lesion classification using deep learning techniques. The Jupyter Notebook processes image data, applies transformations, and utilizes a neural network for classification.

## Features
- Loads and processes skin lesion images from a dataset.
- Applies transformations such as resizing, normalization, and tensor conversion.
- Implements a PyTorch dataset class for efficient data handling.
- Utilizes a deep learning model for classification.
- Provides a testing module to evaluate model performance.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install pandas torch torchvision pillow
